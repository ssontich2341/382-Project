<p>
<font size="4"color="white">Growing up Michael loved the game of basketball, idolizing players like Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson. However, Michael did not have convient access to the necessary equipment required to play. While at a Purdue NCAA tournament game, Michael met his wife Michelle and both had a common interest in basketball and dreamed of how they could make the game easier to reach for people across the country. After years of saving and making sure that everything was in place they finally gave their dream a go. Together they founded Michael and Michelle's March Madness, a basketball store that offers products and services that accomodate the sport of basketball. The business had only one location in Indianapolis at the start but continued to grow each and every year until it was time to expand. Opening new store locations helped Michael and Michelle reach a larger customer base, and more importantly allow easier access to all the needs of basketball. With how popular the sport has become,  Michael and Michelle want to continue to make a positive impact on anyone who enjoys the game of basketball.
